# Python3 has 5 sequence types built in:
# The string type, list, tuple, range, bytes and bytearray

# A sequence is defined as an ordered set of itens
# The string "Hello World" has 11 items and each of them is a character.

 # Because a sequence is ordered, we can use indexdes to access individual items
 # in the sequence.

 computer_parts[1][0] #this is the letter "m" from the item 1, monitor
